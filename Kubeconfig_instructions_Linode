# Below are few simple and yet forgetable steps for configuring Linode kubeconfig file locally on your machine. This will allow you to manage (run kubectl commands ) locally. 


# 1. Once the cluster is created on Linode, then you will get a downloadable kubeconfig file that needs to be stored in .kube directory

cd /home/docker/.kube


# 2. Create a file that will contain the information of Linode kubeconfig. You dont have to create the file you download it and place it in the .kube directory
# The file that has kubeconfig is the "KubeLab-kubeconfig.yaml" file. 
:~/.kube$ ls
cache  config  KubeLab-kubeconfig.yaml


# 3. Next configure the kubeconfig envirnement variable in order interact with Linode kubernetes cluster
# No output will be display after the command is executed 
:~/.kube$ export KUBECONFIG=/home/docker/.kube/KubeLab-kubeconfig.yaml 

# 4. If everything was followed correctly then you should be able to view the result for runnin cluster on linode 

~/.kube$ kubectl get nodes
