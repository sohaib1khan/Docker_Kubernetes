NameSpaces: 

#Allow to group resources or envirnments such as
 > EX. Dev, Test, Prod

# In K8s/Kubernetes a defualt workplaced gets created
# Object in one NameSpaces can access objects in a different NameSpaces.
    > Ex: objectname.prod.svc.cluster.local
# Deleting a NameSpaces will delete all child objects. 


#  NameSpaces

1. You define a NameSpaces
2. You can specify the NameSpace when defining objects.

    NameSpace Defiinition:                                              Pod Defininition:
    apiVersion: v1                                                      apiVersion: v1 
    kind: Namespace                                                     kind: Pod    
    metadata:                                                           metadata:
      name: prod  # defined namespace 'prod'                                name: myapp-pod
                                                                            namespace: prod  # the pod will live in the prod namespace
                                                                        spec:

# kubectl namespace basic command
kubectl get namespace or ns   # List all namespaces 
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=[namespaceName] # Set the current context to use a namespace
kubectl create ns
kubectl delete ns
kubectl get pods  --all-namespaces
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system |or| kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=default







# K8s Architecture  NODES

[Master or control plane]   [Nodes: physical or virtual machines, Together they form a CLUSTER]


# etcd
* Act as the cluster datastore for storing state
* Key-value store
* Not a database or a datastore for application to use
* The single source of truth


# kube-control-manager
* The controller of controlers
* It runs controllers
        >.Node Controller
        >.Replication controller 
        >.Endpoints controller 
        >. Service account & Token controllers


# cloud-control-manager
* interact with the cloud providers controllers
    *Node
        >. For checking the cloud provider to determine if a node has been deleted in the cloud after it stops responding
    *Route
        >. For setting up routes in the underlying cloud infrastructure
    *Service
        >. For creating, updating and deleting cloud provider load balancers         
    *Volume
        >. For creating, attaching, and mounting volumes, and interacting with the cloud provider to orchestrate volumes


# Kube-scheduler
    * Watches newly created pods that have no node assigned, and selects a node for them to run on
    * Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include
        >. Individual and collective resource requirements
        >. Hardware/Software/policy constraints
        >. Affinity and anti-affinity specifications 
        >. Data locality


# Addons
    * DNS
    * Web UI (dashboard)
    * Cluster-level logging
    * Container resource monitoring




# PODS State

    *Pending
        >. Accepted but not yet created
    *Running
        >. Bound to a node
    *Succeeded
        >. Exited with status 0
    *Failed
        >. All containers exit and at least one exited with non-zero status 
    *Unknow
        >. Communication issues with the pod 
    *CrashLoopBackOff
        >. Started, crashed, started again, and then crashed again




# Selectors/Labels:

* Labels
    >. Key-value pairs used to identify, describe and group related sets of objects or resources. Selectors use labels to filter or select objects. 
    * Think of selector as a SQL query 
        select * from Nodes 
        where disktype= SpecifiedName


# Statefulsets 

* Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods.
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/






# Type of deployments

* Deployment
* Statefulset 
* Daemonsets 
* Replicasets
